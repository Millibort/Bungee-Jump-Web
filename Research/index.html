        Honestly I think that you shouhld use a pedigree to be able more easily understand what kkind of desieases you might inheret, or your children.
        It can also be used to halp determine whether what conditions you have are genitic or not

        if you and your partner both have a recessive allele that causes a genetic disorder than there is a possibility that it will get passed down to your children.
        Additionally, if you have a family history of cancers, you are significantly more likely get it aswell.
